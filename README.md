# PepsimanDiscordBotPython
 My Pepsiman discord bot but written in Python instead of JavaScript. Responds to users saying blacklisted drinks by yelling at them and telling them to drink Pepsi instead.

# Usage:
If you want to host this bot yourself, read the notes below. (This assumes you know the basics of creating a bot and installing Python.)
- You must put the bot token in pepsi/settings/token.txt. See token.txt.template in the same folder for more info.
